An UDP-based robot control application with a strong focus on very low latency.
Video and control information is lossy, but the application also provides a
secured channel for non-lossy communications where required.

The basic implementation contains a server (with text-to-speech and serial
communication towards the robot hardware, using x264 for video encoding) and
a client (basic WASD+mouse control scheme and command prompt, using ffmpeg
for video decoding).

The project compiles under Linux and Windows.
