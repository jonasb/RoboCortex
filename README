An UDP-based robot control application with a strong focus on very low latency. Video and control information is lossy, but the application also provides a secured channel for non-lossy communications where required.

Developed for the KiwiRay project - an easy to build, open hardware omnidirectional robot platform.

This basic implementation contains a server (with text-to-speech and serial communication towards the robot hardware, using x264 for video encoding) and a client (basic WASD+mouse control scheme and command prompt, using ffmpeg for video decoding).

The project compiles under Linux and Windows.

The ./sam/ folder contains the speech synthesis library and must be compiled prior to compiling the server and client.
SAM is an old TTS from the C64 (Software Automatic Mouth) and the source code is based on the assembly to C port by Sebastian Macke.

To build on Windows you might want to save yourself the trouble of manually compiling several open-source projects and simply extract the necessary includes, pre-compiled libraries and dlls from the w32-precompiled.zip archive. Compiles as-is using MinGW.
