An UDP-based robot control application with a strong focus on very low latency. Video and control information is lossy, but the application also provides a secured channel for non-lossy communications where required.

Developed for the KiwiRay project - an easy to build, open hardware omnidirectional robot platform.

The basic implementation contains a server (with text-to-speech and serial communication towards the robot hardware, using x264 for video encoding) and a client (basic WASD+mouse control scheme and command prompt, using ffmpeg for video decoding).

The project compiles under Linux and Windows.

To build on Windows you might want to save yourself the trouble of manually compiling several open-source projects and simply download the necessary pre-compiled libraries, which should be available at http://www.forskningsavd.se/wiki/index.php/KiwiDrive_HouseBot
